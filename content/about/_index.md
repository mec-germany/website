### Vision & Mission

The Malaysian Engineering Community (MEC) started as a group of engineers who wanted to connect malaysian engineers who share a common goal to drive technology transfer by empowering them through knowledge and skills fusion.

### Objectives

Our purpose in founding MEC for our members was to:

* Provide a platform to engage with other like-minded engineers by contributing content, commenting on issues discussed and positively networking with individuals.
* Support professional development of working engineers and provide resources and guidance to students and young engineers.
* Share beneficial latest trend and news related to engineering.
