How does autonomous driving work and where does the development of technology stand?

Autonomous driving is one of the four "major topics" of the automotive industry - the other three are electromobility, sharing economy and connectivity. Most car manufacturers are very active in this field, as are automotive suppliers. In addition, new market participants such as sensor and semiconductor manufacturers as well as mobile network operators are competing with established companies in the automotive industry.

#### Level of autonomous driving

The SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) has defined five levels of automated and autonomous driving. This classification has established itself worldwide in the automotive industry.

-   Level 0: No automation

    The driver steers, accelerates and brakes himself.

-   Level 1: Driver Assistance

    The car has individual supporting systems such as anti-lock braking system (ABS) or electronic stability program (ESP), which interact actively.

-   Level 2: Partial Automation

    Automated systems perform partial tasks (e.g. adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, automatic emergency braking). However, the driver remains in control of the vehicle and is responsible for it.

    Example: Audi Traffic Jam Assist, Mercedes-Benz Driver Assistance Systems, Tesla Autopilot, Volvo Pilot Assist.

-   Level 3: Conditional Automation

    The car is able to accelerate, brake and steer by itself in some cases. If necessary, the system prompts the driver to take control.

    Example: Audi Traffic Jam Pilot.

-   Level 4: High Automation

    In normal operation the vehicle can drive fully autonomously. However, the driver has the possibility to intervene and "override" the system.

-   Level 5: Full Automation

    Fully automated, autonomous operation of the vehicle without the possibility (and necessity) of intervention by the driver.

    Example: None yet.

#### Technology: Sensors for autonomous driving

**How does autonomous driving work?** Autonomous driving requires various types of assistance functions that interact in the higher development stages of the overall system. Examples are braking, congestion, lane keeping, turning and parking assistants as well as adaptive cruise control. In addition, there are various sensor systems.

Autonomous vehicles must be equipped with systems for environment detection. In addition to cameras, these passive systems also include ultrasound, radar and lidar sensors for distance measurement and for processing further information from the surroundings of the vehicle. An example: The traffic jam pilot in the Audi A8 - according to the manufacturer's first real driving function according to Level 3 - is equipped with 24 different sensor systems, including five radar sensors and six cameras.

On the active level there must be the possibility of electronic control of the engine, brake and steering. The third prerequisite is the control technology linking of all active and passive systems while maintaining the required safety and very short reaction times.

#### Required technologies for autonomous driving outside the vehicle

The higher development stages of automated driving can only be reliably implemented with purely in-vehicle sensors and electronics if certain conditions have been met (no intersections, no pedestrians). However, the goal is driverless driving on the longest possible routes and in the city. Therefore, the technologies for autonomous driving are closely linked to the trend of connectivity.

Some examples:

-   Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication: Vehicles approaching an intersection exchange signals and make rules for right of way (right before left).
-   Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication: Mobile networks monitor intersection traffic or traffic in entire neighborhoods.
-   Car parks, traffic signs, traffic lights etc. are also included in the communication.

In this context, the expansion of mobile radio networks (5G) has great significance for the practical use of autonomous driving. In addition, a communication infrastructure must be built on a cloud infrastructure.

#### Artificial Intelligence: Autonomous Driving and Deep Learning

In practice, sensor systems for automated or autonomous driving are already delivering good results today - provided the environmental conditions are favourable. Problems arise, for example, in snowfall, missing lane marking and unclear traffic situations. Development work still needs to be done here. This is an application field of artificial intelligence (AI) with neural networks: With the help of "deep learning", the sensor networks learn, for example, to distinguish objects from persons with a very high accuracy rate and to recognize the walking direction of pedestrians.
