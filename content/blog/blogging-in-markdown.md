#### What is Markdown
Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax for composing moderately complex text documents - the types of content you normally use a word processor to write.

---

#### Markdown Syntax

There isn't all that much to it, but you might want to check out the [actual documentation page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). 

The following code,

```
#### H4
##### H5

bulleted list:
* item1
* item2

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

Inline-style:
![alt text](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/raw/master/src/common/images/icon48.png)

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

​```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
​```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

> Blockquotes are very handy in an email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.
```
