12 July 2019 marked my last day at Deiring GmbH as a project engineer. Deiring GmbH is a small size company in Wertheim, Germany. It main business is automation project. Having served this company for just a little over 9 months allows me to experience project engineer life and understand deeply a good project engineer personal traits. As the name suggest, project engineer execute project to meet customer requirements. Simply to say it is the kind of engineer that make sure the project is done. But what makes an excellent project engineer?

An excellent project engineer is normally versatile, communicate well and able to make fast decision. As a project engineer, I involve mainly in programming and integrations. Modern automation systems consists of multiple components, such as:

1.  Control unit (PLC / IPC)
2.  Drive
3.  Pneumatics / Hydraulics
4.  Sensors / encoders
5.  Vision system
6.  Test system
7.  Safety system
8.  Control cabinet
9.  Robot

These components have to communicate with the control unit mainly PLC in order to work as an automated system. The challenge is that these components speak their own languages. This is the reason why a project engineer has to be versatile. He or she needs to find a way to integrate the whole system in order to make it works. This means that a vast knowledge and skills are required to be a good project engineer. But it is impossible to know everything. This is when an excellent communication skill comes in handy.  

As a project engineer I have to be able to request help from senior engineers or components manufacturers. This sounds easy but the challenge is to find the "right" person that really can help. There are many events that require a project engineer to communicate efficiently. These are the key people that I have to come in contact frequently:

1.  Customer: to understand project requirements, propose solutions and training.
2.  Supplier: Product specifications, support or to find solution.  	
3.  Team members (electricians): Motivate team members in order to achieve project timeline.

Able to make fast decision sum up an excellent project engineer. It does not matter whether the decision is right or wrong. Decisions have to be made in order to keep moving. Remember, **<u>fast is always better that correct</u>**.

Here, I would like to thank Deiring GmbH for giving me the chance to learn and work together. May our paths will cross again.
